I am an extremely passionate developer, starting to understand core application logic over 20 years ago, with basic automation, shared libraries and dialogs.  Within the last 10 years, I have throttled this field into the world of web and mobile, touching base on a number of platforms, design patterns and varied database systems.

My greatest attribute is the diversity in my technical understanding, being able to look at new languages and applying my analytical and inquisitive nature and challenging the limits of my imagination.
